# My personal website

Welcome to the Git repository of my website, which also serves as proof of the concept of a single-file website and demonstrates how over-engineered today's web development is. 

# Description

The website is made of one HTML file and nothing else and uses GitHub pages as its hosting. As a simple and minimalistic website, it does not require high scalability or flexibility. It prioritizes typography to enhance the reading experience by excluding complex elements.

Web development need not be complicated or stressful, requiring entire teams. It should simply convey information to the reader without any complications.
